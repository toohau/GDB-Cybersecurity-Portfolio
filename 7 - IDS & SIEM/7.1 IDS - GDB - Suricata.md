# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) - Suricata
> Suricata is an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

> An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. IDS technologies help organizations monitor the activity that happens on their systems and networks to identify indications of malicious activity.

## Overview
There are three ways Suricata can be used: 
1. Intrusion detection system `(IDS)`: Monitor network traffic and alert on suspicious activities and intrusions. In a practical way, it can be a host-based IDS to monitor system and network activities of a single host like a computer.
2. Intrusion prevention system `(IPS)`: Detect and block malicious activity and traffic. It requires additional configuration such as enabling IPS mode.
3. Network security monitoring `(NSM)`: Produce and save relevant network logs (live network traffic, existing packet capture files, full or conditional packet captures). This is beneficial for forensics, incident response and for testing signatures.

Suricata uses signatures analysis, which is a detection method used to find events of interest. Signatures consist of three components:
1. Action: The first component of a signature. It describes the action to take if network or system activity matches the signature. Examples include: alert, pass, drop, or reject.
2. Header: The header includes network traffic information like source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, protocol, and traffic direction.
3. Rule options: The rule options provide you with different options to customize signatures.

## Examine alerts, logs and rules with Suricata 

In this scenario, you’re a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You’ll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you'll explore custom rules in Suricata. Second, you'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the fast.log file. Finally, you’ll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard eve.json log file.

For the purposes of the tests you’ll run in this lab activity, you’ve been supplied with a sample.pcap file and a custom.rules file. These reside in your home folder.

Let’s define the files: 

1. The `sample.pcap` file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which you’ll use to test the Suricata rules. This will allow you to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.
  
2. The `custom.rules` file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. You’ll add rules to this file and run them against the network traffic data in the sample.pcap file.

3. The `fast.log` file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The fast.log file is empty when the lab starts. Each time you test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the fast.log file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The fast.log file can be located in the /var/log/suricata directory after Suricata runs.The fast.log file is considered to be a depreciated format and is not recommended for incident response or threat hunting tasks but can be used to perform quick checks or tasks related to quality assurance.

4. The `eve.json` file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in JSON format. The eve.json file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory.

When you create a new rule, you'll need to test the rule to confirm whether or not it worked as expected. You can use the fast.log file to quickly compare the number of alerts generated each time you run Suricata to test a signature against the `sample.pcap` file.

## Expectation 

* Create custom rules and run them in Suricata
* Monitor traffic captured in a packet capture file
* Examine the fast.log and `eve.json` output

## Step-by-step 

1. Examine a custom rule in Suricata.

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87c5d80a-626d-47c7-a4fa-1e39825fb04b)

```
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
```

* Action
`Alert` : Instructs to alert on selected network traffic. The IDS will inspect the traffic packets and send out an alert in case it matches. 

* Header
`http`: The rule that applies is only to HTTP traffic. The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic from $HOME_NET and going to the destination IP address $EXTERNAL_NET. In this scenario, $HOME_NET is a suricata variable defined in `/etc/suricata/suricata/yaml` as a rule definitions.
$HOME_NET is definatd as the `172.21.224/0/20` subnet. 

* Rule options
`Rule`: Customize signatures with additional parameters.
  * The `msg`: The alert will print out the text `GET on wire`.
  * The `flow:established, to_server`: Determines that packet from the client to the server should be matched (The handshakes: SYN-ACK packet).
  * The `content`: "GET" tells Suricata to look for the word GET in the `http.method` of the packet.
  * The `sid:12345`: Unique numerical value that identify the rule.
  * The `rev:3` indicates the signature's version which is used to identify the signature's version.  

2. Trigger a custom rule in Suricata.
* List the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder: `ls -l /var/log/suricata`. Up this task, there will be no files to be found. 

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3272dba3-05b4-4e23-a522-dfde8f3817a9)

* We run Suricata using the `custom.rules` and `sample.pcap`: `sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none`.
  * The `-r sample.pcap` option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the sample.pcap file.
  * The `-S custom.rules` option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the custom.rules file.
  * The `-k none` option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5bc4301-3cc7-4207-903f-fe371dfa95a7)

* List the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder again: `ls -l /var/log/suricata`.

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata04](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef5fe05b-74d5-4e68-8fdf-5937dd00f39b)

* Display `fast.log`: `cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log`

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e43ddb34-e67c-4a24-9c20-70b5a4b57165)

Here, each line corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each line consists of the rule triggered the alert, source, destination and direction of the traffic. 


3. Examine `eve.json` output.
* Use the cat command to display the entries in the `eve.json` file: `cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json`. The format of the data will be in JSON. 

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae7781ea-612e-43fc-b52a-3a38b0075eb0)

* Let's display the entries in an improved format: `jq . /var/log/suricata/eve/json | less`.

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata07](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/444de362-3ee8-457a-a21c-54f6e35808b4)

* Extract specific event data from `eve.json` file: `jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json`.

![7 1 IDS - GDB - Suricata08](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac3c96f9-a896-4fa5-841a-42711e2ee3e9)

> Press Q to exit the `less` command and return to the command-line prompt.

4. Several things to be found in the `eve.json`:
  * The value of the severity for the first alert returned by the `jq` command is 3.
  * The destination IP address listed for the last event in the `eve.json` file is `142.250.1.102`.
  * The alert signature for the first entry in the `eve.json` is `GET on WIRE`.
